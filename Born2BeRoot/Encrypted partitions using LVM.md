LVM -> Logical Volume Management
When an encrypted LVM partition is used, the encryption key is stored in memory (RAM). Since retrieving this key allows the decryption of the data, it is of recommended to avoid leaving a copy of this key that would be accessible to the possible thief of the computer or volume, or to a maintenance technician. This is however something that can easily occur with a laptop, since when hibernating the contents of RAM is stored on the swap partition. If this partition isn't encrypted, the thief may access the key and use it to decrypt the data from the encrypted partitions. This is why, when you use LVM encrypted partitions, it is recommended to also encrypt the swap partition.Â The Debian installer will warn you or the users if they try to make an LVM encrypted partition while the swap partition is not encrypted.
